# Clustering urban land cover types

Data was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Data Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Urban+Land+Cover

A k-means multivariate clustering model for three clusters was developed to cluster the land cover types.

The clustering was then validated by clustering two randomly selected variables.
